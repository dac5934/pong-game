# Pong by Edwin Lu and Daniel Chai
Play the first computer game ever created again using an ESP32!  
Build your own controller using the schematic included and run the ESP32 code for countless hours of fun!
You can play against a multi difficulty bot or online with your friends.
Small nuances to the game allows for higher skill ceiling gameplay.
The simpleness of the program allows you(yeah you!) to expand the use of the controller allowing you to create and play multiple different games.
Have fun!
